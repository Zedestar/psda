          Pastorsâ€™ Sons and Daughters Association (P.S.D.A.) is a dynamic
          fellowship that unites the children of pastors from the Diocese of
          Morogoro, Tanzania. This association was established with a clear
          vision of fostering connection, growth, and support among the sons and
          daughters of those who serve in pastoral ministry. We are a family
          rooted in faith, bound by shared experiences, and committed to
          uplifting one another spiritually, socially, and economically.
